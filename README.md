# AITrainProblem
You have caused confusion and delay...

An AI system designed to move trains around a node map of stations. The trains will move around the map transporting cargo from station to station using an implementation of Operator Search and Planner. The accompanying research paper will discuss the differences between Operator Search and Planner.

## Clarify:
- [ ] How to Integrate A* with Ops/Planner?
- [ ] How many trains should be working at any one time?

## To Do:
- [ ] Come up with a better train pun
- [ ] Set up Clojure environment
- [ ] Implement Ops Search with simple input
- [ ] Implement Planner with simple input 
- [ ] Build a simple node map to work with the Ops and Planner search
- [ ] Implement a working A* search with the node map
- [ ] Implement Ops/Planner hand off to A* 

## Nice to have:
- [ ] Build node map generator
- [ ] Exand operators for Ops/Planner
- [ ] Any other areas to problem
